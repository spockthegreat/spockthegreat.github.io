While Java development is my primary language, I am always eager to understand all aspects of a system.

I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I like computers - not just playing games but learn how computer programs actually work. Thus, programming came naturally. 

I like to build things that will help people in their everyday lives and make them happy.

I believe

* __>__ Make someone happy today (me)
* __>__ Build software for people first, computers second.
* __>__ Usability is always secondary. (Donald Norman)
* __>__ Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Albert Einstein)
* __>__ Don’t make me think. (Steve Krug)
* __>__ People that think well, write well. (David Ogilvy)
* __>__ Omit needless words. (Strunk & White)
* __>__ Do one thing and do it right. (37signals)
* __>__ Good is the enemy of great. (Jim Collins)
* __>__ Stay hungry, stay foolish. (Steve Jobs)
* __>__ Life shrinks or expands in proportion to ones’ courage (Anais Nin)
* __>__ Michael Jordan is an alien. (me again)

I am an adventurer, a traveller, and a student. I love to learn and experience new things daily.
